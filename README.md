NewsFeed
========

If you open Western's page, you will see a list of news items about campus life. The news feed publishes news from time to time, and these items can be read using a news reader. This is a toy version of such a system, with a tiny news feed and a reader. The news feed will publish news items, and news readers will be able to read and print them.
